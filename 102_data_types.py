# Numerical data types
# - int, long, float, complex
# These are numerical data types whc we can use numerical operators
# Complex and long numbers we don't use so much
# Complex brings and imaginary component to a number
# Long -

# int - Stands for integers
# Whole numbers
my_int = 10
print(my_int)
print(type(my_int))

# Opperator - add, subtract, multiply, devide

print(5+6)
print(8*6)
print(18/3) # Devisions automatically get converted to float
print(9-7)

# Modules looks for rhe number of remeinders
# %
print(22%5) # --> counts how many remainders are left after the devison. Cant be more than the dividing number

# Comaprrison Operators #--> this outputs a boolean value

# == is the comparison operator
# < / >  bigger than, smaller than. Adding
# <= less than or equal to
# >= bigger than or equal too
# != is not equal to
# is and is not
